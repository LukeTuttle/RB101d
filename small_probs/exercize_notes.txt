P Process the problem (understand the problem)
  identify expected input and output
  make the requirements explicit
  idenfity rules
  mental model of the problem (optional)
E Examples/Test Cases 
  validate understanding of the problem
D Data Structure
  how we represent data that we will work with when convertint the input to output
A Algorithm
  steps for converting input to output
C Code
  implementation of Algorithm
