PEDAC (note: you dont need to follow these in order, its just meant to help think about problem at different levels of abstraction and make it more chunked)
P Process the problem (understand the problem)
  identify expected input and output
  make the requirements explicit
  idenfity rules
  mental model of the problem (optional)
E Examples/Test Cases 
  validate understanding of the problem
D Data Structure
  how we represent data that we will work with when convertint the input to output
A Algorithm
  steps for converting input to output
C Code
  implementation of Algorithm

# EASY 2 
in the Random#rand method it will output a number bewtween a min and max when supplied a range object
Enumerator#inject is a useful function which comes with an accumulator object 'memo'. alias: 'reduce'
